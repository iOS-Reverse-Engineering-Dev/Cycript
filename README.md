# Cycript
Cycript allows developers to explore and modify running applications on either iOS or Mac OS X using a hybrid of Objective-C++ and JavaScript syntax through an interactive console that features syntax highlighting and tab completion.
(It also runs standalone on Android and Linux and provides access to Java, but without injection.)
